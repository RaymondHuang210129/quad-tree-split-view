# How to Contribute

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed.
- Ensure the path of the project only contains ASCII characters.

After cloning the repository, execute the install script to install the required
dependencies with vcpkg.
[Vcpkg may require elevation](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html).

```bat
.\install.bat

After the dependencies are installed, open the solution file in Visual Studio.
The project should be ready to build.
